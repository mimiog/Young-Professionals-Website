# Young-Professionals-Website

#### I created this web application as a final project for my web development class. It is a simple website that utilizes a simple form to collect information from a user and then stores the information in a table(database). I used Javascript for my backend, MongoDB for my database, and Angular for the frontend. 

To run this program on your machine, please install all depenencies by following the outlined steps:

- In your vscode/ code editor terminal, type 'cd backend'
- Then run 'npm install' and 'npm install nodemailer' in the terminal. 
- Once all required dependencies have been installed, you can then run 'npm start' to start the backend of the application.
- To run the frontend of the application, you need to first 'cd frontend' in your vscode/ code editor terminal.
- Once done, run 'npm install'.
Once all dependencies are installed, run 'ng serve' to start the frontend of the application. 

#### Note: You need to have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine to be able to run this app.
